Victor would later have Pop Smoke sign a recording contract with Victor Victor Worldwide and Republic Records. He released his debut mixtape Meet the Woo in July 2019.His second mixtape, Meet the Woo 2, was released on February 7, 2020, and debuted at number seven on the Billboard 200, becoming the rapper's first top-10 project in the United States.Twelve days after the mixtape's release, Pop Smoke was murdered during a home invasion in Los Angeles. Fellow New York rapper 50 Cent served as executive producer for his posthumous debut studio album, Shoot for the Stars, Aim for the Moon (2020), which debuted atop the Billboard 200; all 19 of its tracks entered the Billboard Hot 100. The album also spawned the singles "For the Night" (featuring DaBaby and Lil Baby) and "What You Know Bout Love". The following year, Republic released Pop Smoke's second studio album, Faith (2021).</p>
